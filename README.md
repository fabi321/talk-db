# What does it do

It tries to scrape talkshow guests from German public media brodcasters.
This currently includes *Anne Will*, *Hart aber fair*, *Maischberger - Die Woche*, *Maybrit Illner* and *Markus Lanz*.
**It may fail in the future due to inconsistencies.**

I'm planning to publish a Website in the future, based on the data from this repository.
